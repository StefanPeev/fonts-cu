Svobodny font
================================

Svobodny is a new implementation of
[GNU FreeFont](https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/).

The purpose of this project is to provide a font that "looks" like
Times New Roman, but contains all of the necessary characters and
font features for typesetting Church Slavonic, as well as Greek,
Georgian, Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, Syriac, and other scripts used
by researchers in Byzantine Studies, theology, liturgics, philology, 
and related fields. This is because many publishers require texts to be
set in "Times New Roman".

This font is based on GNU FreeFont, which provides a useful set of free scalable
(i.e., OpenType) fonts covering as much as possible of the ISO 10646/Unicode
UCS (Universal Character Set). Svobodny extends upon GNU FreeFont by providing
a number of additional features not available in GNU FreeFont:

* Full compatibility with
[Adobe Glyph List](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-aglfn/blob/master/aglfn.txt)

* Support of proper glyph composition / decomposition and positioning
needed for Church Slavonic support

* Support of the Ponomar Project Private Use Area policy

Coverage
--------

GNU FreeFont covers the following character ranges
* Latin, Cyrillic, and Arabic, with supplements for many languages
* Greek, Hebrew, Armenian, Georgian, Thaana, Syriac
* Devanagari, Bengali, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Sinhala, Tamil, Malayalam, Oriya
* Thai, Tai Le, Kayah Li, Hanun√≥o, Buginese
* Cherokee, Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics
* Ethiopian, Tifinagh, Vai, Osmanya, Coptic
* Glagolitic, Gothic, Runic, Ugaritic, Old Persian, Phoenician, Old Italic
* Braille, International Phonetic Alphabet
* currency symbols, general punctuation and diacritical marks, dingbats
* mathematical symbols, including much of the TeX repertoire of symbols
* technical symbols: APL, OCR, arrows, enclosed alphanumerics
* geometrical shapes, box drawing
* musical symbols, gaming symbols, miscellaneous symbols
  etc.

The Svobodny family has one monospaced - SvobodnyMono - and two
proportional faces (one with uniform stroke - SvobodnySans - and one with
modulated stroke - SvobodnySerif).

The point of having characters from different writing systems in one font
is that mixed text should look good, and so each Svobodny face contains
characters of similar style and weight.
