changes since 12.2

* Added some additional characters to the PUA per the PUA Policy

* Testing on various OS'es and fixing of some problems


September 17, 2014: Release of Hirmos Ponomar BETA 12.2 (Release Candidate 3)
changes since 12.1

* The Kievan Stylistic set (ss01) has been removed
Unicode has now encoded the long-legged form of De (as U+1C81) and so the distinction between the two De's has to be made
at the codepoint level.
Likewise, the "kievan" Graphite feature has been removed.

* Some of the ligatures for Latin have been encoded in the Alphabetic Presentation Forms block

* Note that the contextual substitution of O to narrow O before U is now officially DEPRECATED.
We are keeping it now for compatibility with previously encoded texts, but it will be removed in a future version of the font.
Because the narrow form of On has been encoded in the Unicode standard (at U+1C82), the distinction now has to be made
at the codepoint level.


August 21, 2014: Release of Hirmos Ponomar BETA 12.1 (Release Candidate 2)
changes since 12.0

* We have adopted a Private Use Area (PUA) Allocation Policy
The additional Typicon symbols and the various stylistic and contextual alternatives and ligatures have been reencoded in accordance with version 1.0 of the PUA Policy.
Please see http://www.ponomar.net/files/pua_policy.pdf for more information.

* A number of characters have been added:
U+1F41F FISH
U+1F377 WINE GLASS
U+1F347 GRAPES
These symbols are used in liturgical calendars to indicate fasting guidelines

U+263D FIRST QUARTER MOON
U+263E LAST QUARTER MOON
The extended set:
U+1F311 NEW MOON SYMBOL
through
U+1F318 WANING CRESCENT MOON SYMBOL
and 
U+1F319 CRESCENT MOON
These symbols are used in liturgical calendars and other sources to indicate lunar phases

* A few minor issues have been fixed.

August 14, 2014: Release of Hirmos Ponomar BETA 12.0 (Release Candidate 1)
changes since v. 11.7.0

* Blackletter Latin characters are no longer the default form, rather modern forms have been added

* Blackletter forms have been made part of Stylistic Set 2 (or SIL Graphite feature blackletter)

* Modern punctuation has been added (for use with latin characters)

* Cyrillic Variation sequences have been removed and the characters they referenced have been reencoded at their new locations
 in the proposed Cyrillic Extended-C.

* This version of the font is a RELEASE CANDIDATE

KNOWN ISSUES:
	* Still no pairwise Kerning in Graphite version :(

March 1, 2014: Release of Hirmos Ponomar v. 11.7.0; changes since v. 11.6.6

* Added glyphs for additional Typicon symbols used by Syrnikov (see the proposal for the details). These glyphs include:
	Combining Dot Below					U+0323
	Combining Cedilla	(*)					U+0327
	Combining Breve Below					U+032E
	Combining Low Line					U+0332
	Combining Dot Above Right					U+0358
	One Dot Leader						U+2024
	Two Dot Leader						U+2025
	Horizontal Ellipsis						U+2026
	Double-Ended Multimap					U+29DF

(*) This character forms ligatures with the Small Letter Psi (U+0471) and Small Letter Izhitsa (U+0475), used as Typicon symbols.

* Added the following characters, also used by Syrnikov, which will be proposed for encoding in Unicode:
	Proposed Name						Proposed Codepoint	Block
	DOUBLE COMMA 						U+2E44		Supplemental Punctuation
	LOW KAVYKA						U+2E45		Supplemental Punctuation
	LOW KAVYKA WITH DOT 					U+2E46		Supplemental Punctuation
	INVERTED LOW KAVYKA					U+2E47		Supplemental Punctuation
	INVERTED LOW KAVYKA WITH KAVYKA ABOVE			U+2E48		Supplemental Punctuation
	DOWNWARD FACING HOOK					U+1F54B	Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs
	DOWNWARD FACING HOOK WITH NOTCH			U+1F54C	Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs
	COMBINING INVERTED TORTOISE SHELL BRACKET BELOW	U+1DF6	Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement
	COMBINING DOT ABOVE LEFT				U+1DF7	Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement
	COMBINING KAVYKA ABOVE RIGHT				U+1DF8	Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement
	COMBINING KAVYKA ABOVE LEFT				U+1DF9	Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement
	COMBINING DOT OVERLAY					U+1DFA	Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement


* Added the eight Symbols used in the Typicon of Dolnitsky to the Private Use Area (range U+E200 to U+E208). Note that we are not yet ready to formally propose these characters for inclusion; once we propose these characters, the codepoints are subject to change.

* The appearance of the Zemlya variant U+A641 has been slightly modified

The following changes have been made to Hirmos Ponomar v. 11.6.6 (since v. 11.6.5):

* Fixed a problem with an incorrect substitution in the GDL code that affected the short i and short u

The following changes have been made to Hirmos Ponomar v. 11.6.5 (since v. 11.6.4):

* Added support for positioning of half marks in the Graphite version (thank you to Andri Zuev for reporting the bug)

* U+049E and U+049F -- these two characters have been added. They are used in Aleut.

* Added examples for Romanian Cyrillic and Aleut to the documentation.

The following changes have been made to Hirmos Ponomar v. 11.6.4 (since v. 11.6.3):

* E000 and E001 -- these characters have been deleted. The underlying bug in XeTeX which prevented the usage of ZWJ
	for Cyrillic text has been resolved since XeTeX switched to HarfBuzz, therefore these characters are no longer necessary.
	Moreover, the presence of PUA characters in the lookup rules in GSUB was casuing errors in other software, and 
	these have now been eliminated

* Variation sequence U+0433 U+FE00 -- this sequence has been deleted based on the agreed consensus that it is not a valid variant.
	It is proposed that the underlying glyph (glyph 459, called uni0433FE00) be either remapped to the codepoint U+0491 or deleted.

* U+2027 HYPHENATION POINT -- this character has been added because it is required for CLDR transliterations

* U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE -- this character has been added because it is required for certain technical contexts

* Variation sequences of U+1F545 -- the variations sequences involving the Symbol for Mark's Chapter have been deleted, because 
	a consensus has been reached that the Mark's Chapter Symbol variants will be handled via salt

* salt feature added
	The Stylistic Alternatives (salt) OpenType feature has been added. It provides access to the four variant glyph forms of the
	Symbol for Marks Chapter U+1f545. See HirmosPonomar.pdf for examples and documentation.

* ss01 feature added
	The Stylistic Set 1 (ss01) OpenType feature has been added. It provides "Kievan" glyph shaping behavior, viz., in 
	medial or final position, the letter De takes on the long-legged form and the letter Ze takes on the variant form. See
	HirmosPonomar.pdf for examples and documentation.

* fea1 Graphite feature deleted
	The fea1 Graphite feature has been deleted. It was a dummy feature for testing Graphite support and it is no longer necessary.

* "Use Kievan glyph shapes" Graphite feature added
	This feature reproduces the behavior of Stylistic Set 1 using SIL Graphite. See HirmosPonomar.pdf for examples and documentation.

* "Symbol for Mark's Chapter" Graphite feature added
	This feature reproduces the behavior of salt using SIL Grpahite. See HirmosPonomar.pdf for examples and documentation.

* Stacking of diacritical marks in Graphite has been fixed
	The Graphite rules now allow for correct stacking of extraneous combining marks, as expected.

* Font renaming: the fonts are now distributed with two different names
	The OpenType font is named Hirmos Ponomar
	The TrueType font is named Hirmos Ponomar TT
	This allows for both fonts to be installed simultaneously

KNOWN BUGS
* Still no pairwise Kerning in Graphite version :(
